# WordPressUserTracking
This project represents a solution I designed for a non profit to implement User tracking module and provide them details of user activity.

User activity reported in current module are :

1.Username 	
2.Date entered study	
3.6-week date	
4.Total # log-ins 1st 6 weeks	
5.Total # log-ins	
6.Mean # log-ins/week	
7.Mean time/log-in	
8.Total # BP views 1st 6 weeks	
9.Total # BP views ever	
10.Mean # BP views/week	
11.Total # EBP views 1st 6 weeks	
12.Total # EBP views ever	
13.Mean # EBP views/week	
14.Total # SBP views 1st 6 weeks	
15.Total # SBP views ever	
16.Mean # SBP views/week	
17.Total # PBP views 1st 6 weeks	
18.Total # PBP views ever	
19.Mean # PBP views/week	
20.Total # LBP views 1st 6 weeks	
21.Total # LBP views ever	
22.Mean # LBP views/week

Note: BP is Blog posts and EBP,SBP,PBP, LBP are different categories of blog post which can be customized for your use case.

The user tracking modules depends on two word press plugins to gather the data and store them into the wp_yser_tracking table. 
The plugins are SlimStat and Simple Login Log.
You would require those two plugins to be installed onto your wordpress site prior to running the above scripts.
